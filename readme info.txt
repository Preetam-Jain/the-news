Basic Text Formatting
Bold: To bold text, wrap it with two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__). For example:
**This is bold text** renders as This is bold text.
__This is also bold__ renders as This is also bold.
Italic: To italicize text, wrap it with one asterisk (*) or one underscore (_). For example:
*This text is italicized* renders as This text is italicized.
_This is also italicized_ renders as This is also italicized.
Combining Bold and Italic: You can combine both by using three asterisks or underscores. For example:
***Bold and italic text*** renders as Bold and italic text.
___Bold and italic too___ renders as Bold and italic too.
Headers
Headers are created by placing a hash sign (#) before the text. The number of hash signs indicates the level of the header:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
Lists
Unordered Lists: Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens interchangeably:
* Item 1
+ Item 2
- Item 3
Ordered Lists: Use numbers followed by a period:
1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item
Links and Images
Links: To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets ([ ]), and then wrap the link in parentheses (( )).
[GitHub](http://github.com) renders as GitHub.
Images: Similar to links, but start with an exclamation mark (!), then the alt text in brackets, and the URL in parentheses.
![alt text](image_url.jpg) displays an image from the specified URL.
Code Formatting
Inline Code: Wrap the text with backticks (`).
`Inline code` renders as Inline code.
Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (```) or indent with four spaces for larger blocks of code:
markdown
Copy code
Multiple lines
of code
Copy code
Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, start the line with a greater-than sign (>).

> This is a blockquote.
