3. Original list of topics: Palestine, 2024 Elections, AI, TikTok Ban, Climate Change
4. Aggregate and order article headlines, summaries, and AI analysis chronologically
5. Organize by topic, comparing each source's opinions and bias and their change over time
6. Opinions and bias should come from AI generated analysis, allowing for high throughput of analysis
7. Present different "views" of each article, such as word clouds and trends of words used over time 
8. Explicitly disclaim that this is AI generated content
9. Potential add ons: user discussion under articles, allow users to upload their own analysis, potential AI summaries of user discussions
